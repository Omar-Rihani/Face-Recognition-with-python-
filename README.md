# Face Recognition with OpenCV and face_recognition

A simple real-time face recognition system that detects faces from a webcam, compares them to a dataset of known images, and displays the name of the person if recognized.

## Overview

This project uses `OpenCV` for video processing and `face_recognition` to encode and recognize faces. The system captures video in real-time from your webcam, matches any detected faces with a set of known faces from a folder of images, and labels the recognized faces on the video feed.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition from a webcam.
- Encodes and matches faces using `face_recognition`.
- Displays the name of the recognized person on the video feed.
- Press 'y' to quit the application at any time.
